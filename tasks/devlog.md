# Dev Log

## 2026-05-10 - API Docker build includes reset script

Why: Production API deploy failed in Fly remote build with `failed to calculate checksum ... "/scripts": not found`. The API Dockerfile now copies `scripts ./scripts` so the environment reset tool can run inside Fly, but `.dockerignore` still excluded the entire `scripts/` directory from the build context.

How:
- Updated root `.dockerignore` from excluding all `scripts/` to excluding `scripts/*` with exceptions for `scripts/__init__.py` and `scripts/reset_environment_data.py`.
- This keeps the production reset tool available in the API image without shipping the unrelated COROS probe/dev scripts.

Result:
- `git diff --check` passed.
- The previous failed remote builder path is addressed because `scripts/reset_environment_data.py` is no longer excluded from the Docker build context.

## 2026-05-10 - Reset script normalizes Fly PostgreSQL URLs

Why: User pointed out that the reset command might not properly consider PostgreSQL. The script did have a PostgreSQL deletion branch using `TRUNCATE ... RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE`, but its CLI default read raw `DATABASE_URL` first. Fly commonly provides `postgres://...`, while the app normalizes that to `postgresql+psycopg://...` before creating SQLAlchemy engines. Without doing the same inside the script, the reset command could fail before reaching the PostgreSQL branch.

How:
- Added `normalize_database_url()` to `scripts/reset_environment_data.py`.
- Applied it to CLI default database URLs, direct `reset_environment_data()` calls, and `_create_engine()`.
- Added tests that verify `postgres://...` and `postgresql://...` normalize to `postgresql+psycopg://...`, sqlite URLs stay unchanged, and a Fly-style Postgres URL creates a PostgreSQL psycopg engine without connecting.
- Recorded the maintenance-script URL normalization lesson.

Result:
- `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_reset_environment_data -v` passed 5/5.
- `uv run python -m py_compile scripts/reset_environment_data.py tests/test_reset_environment_data.py` passed.

## 2026-05-10 - Onboarding can enter app without initial plan

Why: User wants first-time login to support entering the product before selecting a training plan. The previous onboarding path always created an athlete, generated a marathon plan, confirmed it, and routed to `/plan`, which made plan selection a hard gate.

How:
- Added a secondary `Enter without a plan` / `先进入系统` action on `/onboarding`.
- Refactored athlete creation in `web/app/onboarding/page.tsx` into `createAthleteProfile()` so the full setup path and skip-plan path persist the same athlete profile and local athlete id.
- The skip-plan path creates only `/api/athletes`, saves `pp_athlete_id`, and routes to `/dashboard`.
- The full path still creates optional marathon goals, calls `/marathon/plans/generate`, confirms the plan, and routes to `/plan`.
- Updated onboarding i18n copy, frontend tests, and README first-run onboarding docs.

Result:
- Focused onboarding test passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/onboarding.test.tsx` -> 8/8 pass.
- Related auth/login/onboarding regression passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/onboarding.test.tsx __tests__/protectedAuthGate.test.tsx __tests__/login.test.tsx` -> 31/31 pass.
- Production build passed: `cd web && pnpm build`.
- Type-check passed after running it sequentially after build: `cd web && pnpm type-check`. A first type-check attempt ran concurrently with `next build` while `.next/types` was being regenerated and failed on missing generated files; the sequential run passed.
- Whitespace check passed: `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-10 - COROS connected settings, sync period, and FIT parse robustness

Why: User reported three COROS issues: after connecting COROS the settings page should not keep showing the account/password form; history sync needs a selectable period instead of always all history; and one real FIT export failed with `Invalid field size 1 for type 'uint32'`, producing a warning without preserving the raw file as a parsed/export row.

How:
- Added `days_back` to `CorosSyncStartRequest` and `sync_days_back` to `ProviderSyncJob` / `ProviderSyncJobOut`, with Alembic migration `d1c9a8f4e2b7_provider_sync_days_back.py`.
- `/coros/sync/start` stores the requested period and queues a window-specific job message.
- `run_coros_full_sync_job()` passes `job.sync_days_back` to the COROS client and uses completion copy such as `COROS sync completed through YYYY-MM-DD` when the client reports the oldest synced activity.
- `RealCorosAutomationClient.fetch_full_history()` accepts `days_back`, stops activity discovery once the cutoff is reached, and reports `days_back` / `synced_until` in stats.
- `upsert_fit_activity_detail()` now archives raw FIT bytes before parsing. If parsing fails, it stores the export row with `parsed_at=NULL`, zero sample/lap counts, and a parser warning instead of raising.
- FIT export sync now logs a warning event for parse failures, increments failed count, and continues with the remaining activities.
- Settings -> COROS now collapses credentials after connection, shows a connected summary, provides an update-login action, adds a sync-period selector, sends `days_back`, and displays job message progress.
- README documents the selected sync period and raw FIT archive behavior.

Result:
- Focused backend COROS verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_coros_full_sync tests.test_real_coros_client -v` -> 24/24 pass.
- Focused frontend COROS settings verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/corosSettings.test.tsx` -> 3/3 pass.
- Broader frontend regression passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/corosSettings.test.tsx __tests__/settings.test.tsx __tests__/protectedAuthGate.test.tsx` -> 11/11 pass.
- Frontend type-check and production build passed: `cd web && pnpm type-check`; `cd web && pnpm build`.
- Full backend unittest discovery passed: `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` -> 118/118 pass.
- Migration verification initially exposed multiple Alembic heads because the new migration pointed at `b9c2e41a6f0d` while `c2a9d8e1b4f3` was already the current head. Updated `d1c9a8f4e2b7_provider_sync_days_back.py` to revise `c2a9d8e1b4f3`; `uv run alembic heads` now reports only `d1c9a8f4e2b7`, and `ST_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////private/tmp/st_coros_sync_days_back_check.db uv run alembic upgrade head` succeeds on a clean SQLite database.
- Whitespace check passed: `git diff --check origin/main`.
- Opened PR #15: https://github.com/paulhandle/ST/pull/15.

## 2026-05-10 - Onboarding default plan generation uses rules by default

Why: User reported that a new user accepting all default onboarding values hit an error on the final generate step. The backend accepted the default finish-goal payload, but with `OPENAI_API_KEY` configured the default marathon skill tried the LLM path first. A focused backend reproduction took 51 seconds before falling back successfully, which is too slow and likely causes browser/proxy timeouts or a generic frontend plan-generation failure in the real onboarding flow.

How:
- Added `use_llm: bool = False` to `MarathonPlanGenerateRequest`.
- Updated `generate_plan_via_skill()` so LLM generation runs only when the environment is configured and the request explicitly opts in with `use_llm=true`.
- Updated onboarding plan generation to send `use_llm: false` for the first-run default plan.
- Changed onboarding plan-generation errors to parse and display backend detail, matching the athlete-creation error path.
- Added backend regression coverage for the exact default onboarding payload: new user, new athlete, finish goal, no race date, no target time, 16 weeks, 3 training days, default skill. The test asserts LLM is not called.
- Added frontend onboarding coverage that clicks through with all defaults and asserts the generated payload includes `use_llm: false`.

Result:
- Confirmed the pre-fix backend default-payload reproduction succeeded only after 51.292s, indicating the LLM path was being attempted before fallback.
- After the fix, focused backend verification passed quickly: `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_auth.ProtectedRoutesTestCase.test_onboarding_default_finish_goal_generates_plan -v` -> 1/1 pass in 0.210s.
- Focused frontend onboarding verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/onboarding.test.tsx` -> 7/7 pass. Existing non-fatal jsdom localstorage-file and React `act(...)` warnings remain.
- Broader focused frontend verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/onboarding.test.tsx __tests__/protectedAuthGate.test.tsx __tests__/auth.test.ts __tests__/apiClient.test.ts __tests__/login.test.tsx` -> 49/49 pass.
- Backend auth verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_auth -v` -> 38/38 pass.
- Full backend verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` -> 115/115 pass.
- Frontend type-check passed: `cd web && pnpm type-check`.
- Frontend production build passed: `cd web && pnpm build`.
- Whitespace verification passed: `git diff --check origin/main`.

## 2026-05-10 - Protected route entry auth gate

Why: User pointed out that authenticated pages should validate real login state at route entry, not let each page or API call discover invalid state independently. The prior stale-session cleanup was useful, but it still allowed protected page code to start before the app knew the token represented a real current user.

How:
- Added `web/components/ProtectedAuthGate.tsx` and mounted it in `web/app/layout.tsx` around all routes.
- The gate treats public paths (`/`, `/login`, `/api`, `/icons`, Next assets, and static files) as public.
- For protected paths, it requires a local token, then calls `/api/auth/me` with the bearer token before rendering children.
- If `/auth/me` succeeds, protected page content renders. If it fails, the gate clears local auth state and redirects to `/login`. Structured `user_not_found` responses reuse the stale-session cleanup path.
- Kept API-client stale-session cleanup as a fallback for post-entry auth failures.
- Added `web/__tests__/protectedAuthGate.test.tsx` covering public route pass-through, protected route validation before rendering, and deleted-user-token cleanup before rendering protected content.
- Recorded the route-entry auth-gate lesson in `tasks/lessons.md`.

Result:
- Focused frontend verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/protectedAuthGate.test.tsx __tests__/auth.test.ts __tests__/apiClient.test.ts` -> 24/24 pass.
- Broader frontend verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/protectedAuthGate.test.tsx __tests__/auth.test.ts __tests__/apiClient.test.ts __tests__/onboarding.test.tsx __tests__/login.test.tsx __tests__/settings.test.tsx __tests__/middleware.test.ts` -> 54/54 pass.
- Focused backend auth verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_auth -v` -> 37/37 pass.
- Full backend verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` -> 114/114 pass.
- Frontend type-check passed: `cd web && pnpm type-check`.
- Frontend production build passed: `cd web && pnpm build`.
- Whitespace verification passed: `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-10 - Reset stale browser session recovery

Why: The new diagnostics showed the exact failure after environment reset: `Token user not found (user_not_found)`. The reset script correctly deletes users and account aliases, but the browser can still have an old JWT in cookie/localStorage. Middleware only checks token presence, so the stale session reaches `/onboarding`; backend then rejects athlete creation because the token subject no longer exists.

How:
- Added structured auth error helpers to `web/lib/auth.ts`:
  - Parse backend `{detail: {code, reason, message}}` payloads.
  - Detect `auth_unauthorized` + `user_not_found`.
  - Clear `st_token`, `pp_athlete_id`, and the auth cookie.
  - Redirect to `/login` when running in the browser.
- Updated `web/lib/api/client.ts` so `fetcher`, `postJson`, and `apiFetch` all handle stale reset sessions on 401 responses before throwing.
- Updated `web/app/onboarding/page.tsx` so its hand-written `/api/athletes` fetch uses the same stale-session handling while still showing diagnostic detail.
- Added `web/__tests__/apiClient.test.ts` plus auth/onboarding test coverage for reset-stale sessions.
- Updated README reset docs to state that reset invalidates browser sessions and the web app clears stale tokens on `user_not_found`.
- Recorded the reset/session lesson in `tasks/lessons.md`.

Result:
- Focused frontend verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/auth.test.ts __tests__/apiClient.test.ts __tests__/onboarding.test.tsx` -> 25/25 pass. Existing non-fatal jsdom localstorage-file and React `act(...)` warnings remain in onboarding tests.
- Broader frontend verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/auth.test.ts __tests__/apiClient.test.ts __tests__/onboarding.test.tsx __tests__/login.test.tsx` -> 43/43 pass.
- Focused backend auth/reset verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_auth tests.test_reset_environment_data -v` -> 40/40 pass.
- Full backend verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` -> 114/114 pass.
- Frontend type-check passed: `cd web && pnpm type-check`.
- Frontend production build passed: `cd web && pnpm build`.
- Whitespace verification passed: `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-10 - Auth 401 diagnostics before next onboarding fix

Why: User reported that athlete creation still failed after previous token-store fixes, and correctly pointed out that the backend only logged `INFO: ::1:0 - "POST /athletes HTTP/1.1" 401 Unauthorized`, which is not enough to identify the precise cause. The next change needed to improve observability before making another behavioral guess.

How:
- Updated `app/core/auth.py` with `decode_token_details()` so auth failures now have reason codes: `missing_credentials`, `invalid_format`, `invalid_signature`, `expired`, `invalid_payload`, `decode_error`, and `user_not_found`.
- Added safe auth warning logs through logger `app.auth`. Logs include method, path, reason, bearer scheme presence, a 12-character sha256 token fingerprint, and user id when decoded. Raw tokens are never logged.
- Changed `get_current_user()` 401 details to structured payloads: `{code, reason, message}`.
- Updated `web/app/onboarding/page.tsx` so failed `/api/athletes` responses parse backend JSON detail and show the reason next to the localized "create athlete failed" message.
- Added backend tests for missing token, invalid token signature, and token user missing on `POST /athletes`.
- Added frontend onboarding coverage proving backend auth details are visible in the error state.
- Recorded the diagnostic-first lesson in `tasks/lessons.md`.

Result:
- Focused backend verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_auth -v` -> 37/37 pass, with diagnostic `auth_failure` logs visible for protected-route failures.
- Focused frontend verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/onboarding.test.tsx __tests__/auth.test.ts __tests__/login.test.tsx` -> 39/39 pass. Existing non-fatal jsdom localstorage-file and React `act(...)` warnings remain.
- Full backend verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` -> 114/114 pass.
- Frontend type-check passed: `cd web && pnpm type-check`.
- Frontend production build passed: `cd web && pnpm build`.
- Whitespace verification passed: `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-10 - Cookie/localStorage token precedence fix

Why: User still saw "创建运动档案失败" and backend `POST /athletes` returning 401 after the initial cookie fallback fix. The remaining root cause is a mismatched auth store: middleware can admit `/onboarding` using the current `st_token` cookie, while `getToken()` still preferred a stale `localStorage.st_token` and sent the stale bearer token to the backend.

How:
- Updated `web/lib/auth.ts` so `getToken()` reads both stores, prefers the cookie when present, and syncs localStorage to that cookie token.
- Kept the legacy migration path where a localStorage-only token writes the cookie for older sessions.
- Added a regression test for stale localStorage plus current cookie.
- Added an onboarding assertion that `/api/athletes` receives the bearer token from the auth helper.

Result:
- Confirmed the new stale-token test failed before the fix: `pnpm test __tests__/auth.test.ts` failed expecting the cookie token but receiving the stale localStorage token.
- Focused frontend verification passed after the fix: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/auth.test.ts __tests__/onboarding.test.tsx __tests__/login.test.tsx` -> 38/38 pass. Existing non-fatal jsdom localstorage-file and React `act(...)` warnings remain in onboarding tests.

## 2026-05-10 - Cookie fallback for onboarding auth

Why: User reported `POST /athletes` returning 401 during onboarding. Root cause: protected routing can allow `/onboarding` because middleware sees the `st_token` cookie, but the client-side `getToken()` helper only read localStorage. If localStorage was empty or unavailable, onboarding sent `/api/athletes` without `Authorization`.

How:
- Updated `web/lib/auth.ts` so `getToken()` reads localStorage first and falls back to the `st_token` cookie.
- Kept the existing localStorage-to-cookie migration behavior for older sessions.
- Added a frontend auth regression test for cookie-only token reads.
- Recorded the cookie fallback lesson in `tasks/lessons.md`.

Result:
- Focused frontend verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/auth.test.ts __tests__/onboarding.test.tsx __tests__/login.test.tsx` -> 37/37 pass.
- Frontend type-check passed: `cd web && pnpm type-check`.
- Frontend production build passed: `cd web && pnpm build`.
- Whitespace verification passed: `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-10 - Environment reset tooling

Why: User needs a reliable way to reset local data during development and reset the Fly environment before official launch. Existing cleanup tooling only removed fake COROS rows, which is not enough for a full pre-launch environment reset.

How:
- Added `scripts/reset_environment_data.py`, an environment-level reset command. It defaults to dry-run and requires both `--execute` and `--confirm-reset` before deleting rows.
- The script uses SQLAlchemy metadata to target all known application tables except preserved global seed/config tables (`training_methods`). This avoids maintaining a brittle hand-written list of product tables.
- Executed resets clear users, account aliases, passkeys, OTP/challenge rows, athletes, plans, structured workouts, activities, COROS accounts, raw provider records, sync jobs/events, coach messages, and related product data.
- The script re-runs `seed_training_methods()` after deletion. SQLite resets `sqlite_sequence`; Postgres/Fly uses `TRUNCATE ... RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE`.
- Updated `Dockerfile.api` to copy `scripts/` into the API runtime image so the reset command can be run with `flyctl ssh console`.
- Updated README with local and Fly reset commands.
- Added `tests/test_reset_environment_data.py` covering dry-run non-deletion, confirmation guard, execution deletion, preservation of `training_methods`, and SQLite id reset.

Result:
- Focused reset verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_reset_environment_data -v` -> 3/3 pass.
- Compile verification passed: `uv run python -m py_compile scripts/reset_environment_data.py tests/test_reset_environment_data.py`.
- Local dry-run passed: `uv run python scripts/reset_environment_data.py` printed target counts for `st.db` and did not delete rows.
- Full backend verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` -> 112/112 pass.
- Whitespace verification passed: `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-10 - Onboarding priority, COROS nudge, and Activities status design

Why: User feedback made it clear that first-run setup should not block on COROS credentials. The core product flow is goal setup, coach skill selection, and plan generation. COROS should be introduced after entry as an optional data-sync improvement. The user also pointed out that Settings lacked an explicit way back, and the Activities tab needed clearer visual distinctions between historical execution and future plan states.

How:
- Reworked `web/app/onboarding/page.tsx` so step 1 is a product/setup intro. Removed COROS username/password state, the onboarding `/api/coros/connect` call, the skip-COROS action, and COROS from confirmation.
- Added `web/components/CorosNudge.tsx` and mounted it from `web/app/(tabs)/layout.tsx`. The nudge links to `/settings/coros`, dismisses through `pp_coros_nudge_dismissed`, and handles unavailable `localStorage`.
- Added explicit settings navigation in `web/app/settings/page.tsx`, `web/app/settings/security/page.tsx`, and `web/app/settings/coros/page.tsx` using deterministic links instead of browser-history assumptions.
- Redesigned `web/app/(tabs)/activities/page.tsx` and `web/components/activities/MonthStrip.tsx` around the existing calendar statuses: `completed`, `partial`, `unmatched`, `miss`, and `planned`. Added status legend/help copy and stable CSS classes in `web/app/globals.css`.
- Updated frontend tests for onboarding, Activities status states, COROS nudge behavior, and settings back links. Updated README first-run and route docs to match the new flow.

Result:
- Focused frontend verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/onboarding.test.tsx __tests__/blockE.test.tsx __tests__/settings.test.tsx __tests__/corosSettings.test.tsx __tests__/components.test.tsx` -> 35/35 pass.
- Full frontend verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test` -> 105/105 pass. Existing non-fatal jsdom localstorage-file and React `act(...)` warnings remain in older onboarding tests.
- Frontend type-check passed: `cd web && pnpm type-check`.
- Frontend production build passed: `cd web && pnpm build`.
- Whitespace verification passed: `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-08 - Athlete ownership after onboarding

Why: User reported that the same test-environment user had to go through the new-user flow every time. Root cause: `/athletes` required authentication but ignored the current user when creating `AthleteProfile`, leaving onboarding-created athlete rows with `user_id=NULL`. Later Google login correctly looked at `user.athletes`, found no owned athlete, and routed the completed user back to onboarding.

How:
- Updated `create_athlete()` in `app/api/routes.py` to create `AthleteProfile(..., user_id=current_user.id)`.
- Added backend regression coverage proving authenticated athlete creation stores ownership.
- Added a Google login regression test for the exact flow: first Google login has no athlete, onboarding creates an athlete with the returned token, second Google login returns `has_athlete=true` and the created `athlete_id`.

Result:
- Focused auth verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_auth -v` -> 35/35 pass.
- Full backend verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` -> 109/109 pass.

## 2026-05-08 - Google login first-click redirect reliability

Why: User reported that production Google login required two clicks: after the first Google login the page stayed on `/login`, and a second click entered the app while also showing the Google authorization prompt again. The likely root cause is a client navigation timing issue after auth state changes: the login handler saved localStorage/cookie and then used Next `router.replace()`, which can leave the existing login page client state alive across Google popup and middleware/cookie synchronization.

How:
- Added a `navigateAfterAuth()` helper in `web/app/login/page.tsx`.
- Successful Google/SMS login now saves token and athlete state first, then uses `window.location.assign()` for `/dashboard` or `/onboarding`.
- Existing-token login-page migration uses the same hard navigation helper.
- Kept the previous Google in-flight guard so duplicate credential callbacks still issue only one `/api/auth/google` request.
- Updated `web/__tests__/login.test.tsx` to assert browser navigation with `window.location.assign()` for Google success, OTP success, existing-token migration, no-athlete routing, and with-athlete routing.

Result:
- Focused frontend verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/login.test.tsx __tests__/auth.test.ts` -> 32/32 pass.
- Frontend production build passed: `cd web && pnpm build`.
- Initial parallel `pnpm type-check` hit a transient `.next/types` missing-file race while `next build` was regenerating build output; rerunning after build passed: `cd web && pnpm type-check`.

## 2026-05-08 - Auth onboarding boundary hardening

Why: User reported `404 {"detail":"Athlete not found"}` after logging in, then clicking Google login again before the new-registration/onboarding flow had completed. Root cause: auth routing used `is_new_user` as a proxy for setup completion. A repeated Google login can correctly return `is_new_user=false` because the account alias already exists, while the account still has no `AthleteProfile`. The frontend then routed to `/dashboard`, where athlete-scoped endpoints failed.

How:
- Extended `VerifyOTPResponse` with `has_athlete` and `athlete_id`.
- Updated shared backend `_auth_response()` so SMS OTP, Google login, and passkey login all return explicit athlete setup state.
- Changed `/login` to route to `/dashboard` only when `has_athlete=true` and a positive `athlete_id` is present.
- Cleared stale local `pp_athlete_id` and routed to `/onboarding` whenever the auth response has no athlete.
- Added `getStoredAthleteId()` for contexts that need to distinguish "no athlete id stored" from the legacy `getAthleteId()` fallback of `1`.
- Changed the existing-token migration on `/login` so a token without a stored athlete id goes to `/onboarding`, not `/dashboard`.
- Added a Google login in-flight guard to ignore duplicate credential callbacks while a login request is pending.
- Added backend regression tests for repeat Google login without an athlete and existing Google login with an athlete.
- Added frontend regression tests for no-athlete routing, athlete-id storage, existing-token routing, duplicate Google callbacks, and explicit athlete-id storage helpers.
- Updated README auth/onboarding docs and recorded the routing lesson in `tasks/lessons.md`.

Result:
- Focused backend auth verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_auth -v` -> 34/34 pass.
- Full backend verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` -> 108/108 pass.
- Focused frontend verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/login.test.tsx __tests__/auth.test.ts` -> 32/32 pass.
- Full frontend verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test` -> 100/100 pass. Existing non-fatal jsdom localstorage and React `act(...)` warnings remain in older onboarding tests.
- Frontend type-check passed: `cd web && pnpm type-check`.
- Frontend production build passed: `cd web && pnpm build`.

## 2026-05-08 - Activities timeline-first review UX

Why: User said the Activities tab calendar management felt inefficient and accepted moving toward a timeline-first interaction. The old page put MonthStrip in the primary position, which is useful for date picking but inefficient for reviewing recent real workouts.

How:
- Kept the existing `/calendar` API and `CalendarDay` data shape.
- Changed `/activities` to default to a Timeline view with a segmented Timeline/Calendar switch.
- Added summary metrics for the currently visible filtered rows: activity count, activity distance, activity duration, and planned count.
- Added status filter chips alongside sport filters, with accessible labels to disambiguate duplicated filter/status text.
- Added month jump chips in Timeline view so users can jump directly to a month without scanning the date strip.
- Kept `MonthStrip` only in Calendar view as a secondary date locator.
- Updated `web/__tests__/blockE.test.tsx` to cover default Timeline view, filter chips, link behavior, Calendar view MonthStrip, and status filtering.

Result:
- Focused Activities verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/blockE.test.tsx` -> 15/15 pass.
- Full frontend verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test` -> 94/94 pass.
- Frontend type-check passed: `cd web && pnpm type-check`.
- Frontend production build passed: `cd web && pnpm build`.

## 2026-05-08 - Runtime auth config and stale Next chunk cleanup

Why: User reported `/workouts/2026-07-05` failing with `Cannot find module './vendor-chunks/swr@2.4.1_react@18.3.1.js'`, then asked how passkey should be configured and whether SMS can be hidden online until an SMS vendor is ready.

How:
- Stopped the stale local Next.js process on port 3000, removed `web/.next`, and restarted `npm run dev`.
- Verified `http://127.0.0.1:3000/workouts/2026-07-05` no longer raises a missing chunk error; unauthenticated access now returns the expected 307 redirect to `/login`.
- Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_SMS_LOGIN_ENABLED`. Local `web/.env.local` sets it to `true`; the web Dockerfile defaults it to `false`; GitHub Actions production deploy passes `NEXT_PUBLIC_SMS_LOGIN_ENABLED=false`.
- Updated the login page to hide the SMS fallback entry when `NEXT_PUBLIC_SMS_LOGIN_ENABLED=false`.
- Set Fly `st-api` WebAuthn production secrets: `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID=performanceprotocol.io`, `WEBAUTHN_RP_NAME=PerformanceProtocol`, and `WEBAUTHN_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://performanceprotocol.io,https://www.performanceprotocol.io`.
- Updated README with SMS visibility and passkey production/local configuration.

Result:
- Focused frontend verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/login.test.tsx __tests__/planPage.test.tsx` -> 15/15 pass.
- Full frontend verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test` -> 92/92 pass.
- Frontend type-check passed: `cd web && pnpm type-check`.
- Frontend production build passed: `cd web && pnpm build`.
- Runtime route check passed: `curl -i http://127.0.0.1:3000/workouts/2026-07-05` returned HTTP 307 to `/login` with no missing vendor chunk error.
- Fly secret update passed: both `st-api` machines rolled and reported healthy checks.

## 2026-05-08 - Plan volume curve response normalization

Why: User reported `/plan` crashed after setup with `curve.map is not a function` in `web/app/(tabs)/plan/page.tsx`. The backend returns `PlanVolumeCurveOut` as a wrapper object with a `weeks` array, while the frontend typed the SWR result as `VolumeCurveWeek[]` and called `.map` directly on the object.

How:
- Added `VolumeCurveOut` to `web/lib/api/types.ts` to mirror the backend response.
- Updated `/plan` to normalize the volume-curve payload through `normalizeVolumeCurve()`, using `payload.weeks` for the current API shape and tolerating a legacy direct array.
- Changed phase/chart/week-list rendering to depend on `curve.length > 0`, so object payloads and empty payloads do not crash.
- Added `web/__tests__/planPage.test.tsx` covering the backend wrapper-object shape.

Result:
- Focused Plan page verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/planPage.test.tsx` -> 1/1 pass.
- Full frontend verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test` -> 91/91 pass.
- Frontend type-check passed: `cd web && pnpm type-check`.
- Frontend production build passed: `cd web && pnpm build`.

## 2026-05-07 - Quiet SMS fallback on login

Why: User noted that the SMS login fallback was still too visually prominent. Since Google/passkey are the intended primary auth paths, SMS should stay available without competing with the main actions.

How:
- Changed the `/login` SMS fallback affordance from a full-width dashed secondary button to a small centered one-line text link.
- Added a login test assertion that the SMS fallback trigger uses the text-link variant.
- Recorded the UI preference in `tasks/lessons.md`.

Result:
- Focused login verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/login.test.tsx` -> 13/13 pass.

## 2026-05-07 - Account aliases for multi-method login

Why: User hit Google login failure on local SQLite: `no such column: users.email`. The immediate cause was a half-migrated local DB, but the deeper design issue was that Google email/profile claims were being stored and queried on `users`. The account model needs to support multiple login forms by storing provider handles in an alias table.

How:
- Replaced the auth identity model/table with `AccountAlias` / `account_aliases`.
- Kept `users` as the account owner table. Provider subjects and claims now live on aliases: phone aliases, email aliases, Google aliases, and passkey aliases.
- Updated Google login to look up by Google `sub`, then by normalized email alias, creating a new user only when no alias exists.
- Updated SMS OTP login and phone linking to resolve ownership through phone aliases, not `users.phone`.
- Updated passkey registration/login to use alias-derived user names and email-specific passkey discovery through email aliases.
- Updated the auth Alembic migration and README auth storage table.
- Repaired local `st.db` non-destructively after creating `var/db_backups/st-before-account-alias-20260507.db`: made `users.phone` nullable, created `account_aliases`, copied existing `auth_identities`, created phone aliases for existing users, and added email aliases where previous identity rows had email.

Result:
- Backend auth focused verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_auth -v` -> 32/32 pass.
- Local SQLite schema now has `account_aliases` and nullable `users.phone`; existing aliases currently include phone aliases migrated from local users.
- Full backend verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` -> 106/106 pass.
- Frontend verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test` -> 90/90 pass, `cd web && pnpm type-check`, and `cd web && pnpm build`.
- Clean SQLite migration verification passed: `ST_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:////private/tmp/st_auth_migration_check_20260507.db uv run alembic upgrade head`.
- Whitespace verification passed: `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-07 - Google Sign-In browser wiring

Why: User provided the Google OAuth web client id and asked to adjust the app/env from that value. The backend Google endpoint already existed, but the login page still showed Google as an unavailable primary method and never loaded Google Identity Services.

How:
- Added `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` to local `.env`, and added `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` to `web/.env.local` so local Next.js runs can render the Google sign-in button. While editing local env, corrected the local `OPENAI_MODEL` key typo.
- Added `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` placeholders to `.env.example` and documented why both are needed in README.
- Updated `web/app/login/page.tsx` to load `https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client`, initialize Google Identity Services with `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, render the GIS button, POST the returned ID token to `/api/auth/google`, save the returned app token, and route to onboarding or dashboard based on `is_new_user`.
- Updated the web Dockerfile and GitHub Actions Fly deploy command so the public Google client id is present during the production Next.js build.
- Set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` on Fly app `st-api` with `flyctl secrets set`, so the production API runtime can verify Google ID tokens after this auth branch is deployed.
- Added login page regression coverage for a configured Google credential flow and for the missing-config fallback path.

Result:
- Frontend focused verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/login.test.tsx` -> 13/13 pass.
- Full frontend verification passed: `cd web && pnpm test` -> 90/90 pass. Existing non-fatal jsdom `--localstorage-file` and React `act(...)` warnings remain from prior onboarding tests.
- Frontend type-check passed: `cd web && pnpm type-check`.
- Frontend production build passed: `cd web && pnpm build`.
- Backend auth focused verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_auth -v` -> 32/32 pass.
- Fly secret update passed: `flyctl secrets set GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=... --app st-api` rolled both machines and reported healthy checks.
- Whitespace verification passed: `git diff --check`.

## 2026-05-07 - Auth modernization foundation

Why: User called out that SMS OTP login is expensive and asked to prepare Google account login and passkey support, while keeping SMS as a fallback and allowing phone addition in personal settings with anti-abuse controls.

How:
- Added `google-auth`, `webauthn`, and `requests` backend dependencies.
- Changed the auth model from phone-only accounts to account plus identities: nullable `users.phone`, optional email/display/avatar fields, `auth_identities`, `webauthn_credentials`, and `auth_challenges`.
- Added Alembic migration `c2a9d8e1b4f3_auth_identities_passkeys.py`.
- Reworked `app/api/auth.py` so OTP, Google, and passkey flows all return the existing JWT response shape. Added `/auth/google`, passkey registration/login option and verify endpoints, and phone-link endpoints for authenticated users.
- Added OTP anti-abuse limits: per-phone send limit, per-IP send limit, and per-phone failed verification limit over the recent one-hour window.
- Updated `/login` to prioritize Google and passkey actions, with SMS behind an explicit fallback option.
- Added `/settings/security` for passkey setup and phone fallback linking, and added an Account security row in Settings/Me.
- Updated README with Google/passkey config, auth storage tables, and new auth routes.

Result:
- Backend auth tests cover Google create/link, missing Google config, OTP rate limits, phone identity creation, passkey option challenge storage, and passkey allow-credentials discovery.
- Targeted backend verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_auth -v`.
- Full backend verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` -> 106/106 pass.
- Targeted frontend verification passed: `pnpm test __tests__/login.test.tsx __tests__/settings.test.tsx __tests__/auth.test.ts`.
- Remaining implementation gap: frontend currently exposes Google/passkey entry points and backend endpoints, but full browser Google Identity Services and WebAuthn `navigator.credentials.create/get` ceremony wiring is still the next step before production use.

## 2026-05-07 - P squared app icon

Why: User asked for an icon in the compact `P^2` form. The app already had an inline compact brand mark in navigation, but the browser/PWA manifest still had no real icon asset.

How:
- Added `web/public/icons/pp-icon.svg`, a black/orange SVG app icon with an italic `P` and a right-superscript `2`.
- Registered the icon in `web/public/manifest.json` with `sizes: "any"` and `purpose: "any maskable"`.
- Added Next metadata icon entries in `web/app/layout.tsx` for browser shortcut and app icon use.
- Added `web/__tests__/manifest.test.ts` to guard that the manifest references the compact P squared icon.

Result:
- Focused frontend tests passed: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/manifest.test.ts __tests__/components.test.tsx`.
- Production build passed: `cd web && pnpm build`.
- Type-check passed after build regenerated `.next/types`: `cd web && pnpm type-check`.
- `git diff --check`: pass.

Follow-up:
- User hit `Error: Cannot find module './270.js'` from `web/.next/server/webpack-runtime.js`. The local `.next` directory had mixed/stale Next output: the runtime looked for `./270.js` while the rebuilt chunk existed at `web/.next/server/chunks/270.js`.
- Found two Node processes listening on port 3000, stopped them, removed `web/.next`, and rebuilt successfully.
- Runtime verification after rebuild: `/` returned HTTP 200 and no chunk error.
- Also fixed `web/middleware.ts` to allow `/icons/*` publicly; before that, `/icons/pp-icon.svg` was redirected to `/login`, which would prevent the new app icon from loading for unauthenticated users.
- Added `web/__tests__/middleware.test.ts` covering public icon access and protected route redirects.

## 2026-05-07 - First-run onboarding skill selection and plan activation

Why: User reported that after first login they entered COROS credentials and configured their goal, but the Plan tab was still empty. Root cause: onboarding only created an athlete, optionally connected COROS, and attempted a stale goal endpoint. It never exposed the product-core skill choice, never called `/marathon/plans/generate`, never confirmed the generated plan, and most authenticated frontend surfaces still assumed athlete id `1`.

How:
- Reworked `web/app/onboarding/page.tsx` from four steps to five: COROS, goal, availability, skill, and confirmation.
- Added onboarding skill loading from `/api/skills` with a built-in fallback skill, plan-week selection, selected skill confirmation, and blocking plan-generation error messaging.
- Updated onboarding submit to create the athlete, save the returned athlete id via `saveAthleteId()`, optionally connect COROS, create a marathon goal through `/api/marathon/goals`, generate a plan through `/api/marathon/plans/generate` with `skill_slug`, availability, target, weeks, and optional race goal id, confirm the plan through `/api/plans/{plan_id}/confirm`, then route to `/plan`.
- Added `pp_athlete_id` local storage helpers in `web/lib/auth.ts`, and replaced hardcoded athlete `1` in dashboard/today/calendar/workout/activity detail/COROS settings/coach sheet/manual plan generation hooks and pages.
- Updated frontend i18n copy and regression tests for onboarding skill selection, athlete id storage, dynamic hook URLs, COROS settings auth mocks, and existing Block E plan-generation tests.

Result:
- First-run completion now creates and activates a real selected-skill training plan, so the Plan tab is populated immediately after onboarding.
- `cd web && pnpm test`: 82/82 pass. Existing non-fatal warnings remain from jsdom `--localstorage-file` setup and React `act(...)` notices in onboarding tests.
- `cd web && pnpm type-check`: pass.
- `cd web && pnpm build`: pass.
- `git diff --check`: pass.

## 2026-05-07 - FIT-based COROS activity detail and Me navigation

Why: User confirmed GPS data is required and asked to implement the final, non-MVP activity detail experience. The previous list/detail payload path did not match COROS Training Hub; the export drawer data is richer and includes GPS/time-series/laps.

How:
- Added `fitparse==1.2.0`, `app/tools/coros/fit_parser.py`, `tests/test_coros_fit_parser.py`, and parser coverage against the real sample FIT export for activity `477263761401479169`.
- Added activity detail persistence models and migration for `activity_detail_exports`, `activity_detail_samples`, and `activity_detail_laps`. Added `app/ingestion/activity_details.py` to upsert raw FIT bytes, SHA-256 hash, source metadata, warnings, all parsed samples, and all parsed laps.
- Added `scripts/coros_import_fit_export.py` for one-off local imports of downloaded FIT exports. Imported the real Beijing run sample into local `st.db` as activity id `145`.
- Updated `RealCorosAutomationClient` with `download_activity_fit_export(label_id, sport_type)`, using `POST /activity/detail/download?...&fileType=4`, downloading the returned `fileUrl`, and returning raw bytes. Full sync now discovers activities from `/activity/query`, no longer attempts `/activity/detail/filter`, then downloads/parses one FIT export per activity with progress events and warning accounting.
- Added `GET /athletes/{athlete_id}/activities/{activity_id}` returning normalized activity summary, source metadata, downsampled samples, detailed laps, route bounds, and interpretation text.
- Added frontend detail types/hook/page at `web/app/activities/[id]/page.tsx`. The page renders a real GPS SVG route, HR/pace/elevation/cadence charts, laps, training interpretation, and FIT source/debug metadata.
- Updated Activities rows so real activities link to `/activities/{activity_id}` while planned rows stay on `/workouts/{date}`. Removed Week from the primary tab bar and added `/me`, which reuses the settings entry points.
- Updated README, `tasks/todo.md`, and `tasks/lessons.md` with the FIT-only production decision and local import/testing command.

Result:
- Real sample import result: `477263761401479169.fit` stored as 173080 bytes, 4092 samples, 11 laps, SHA-256 `b434f43c2422b788eb388cf291e1597f27c1fb0cdbc9649f4f38b6f933a93e73`, 0 parser warnings.
- Targeted backend verification passed: `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_coros_full_sync tests.test_coros_fit_parser -v`.
- Targeted frontend verification passed: `pnpm type-check` and `pnpm test __tests__/blockE.test.tsx __tests__/activityDetail.test.tsx`.
- Local `uv run alembic upgrade head` could not be used on the existing `st.db` because tables already exist without a matching Alembic version stamp (`otp_codes already exists`). For local review only, `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` was used to add missing tables without deleting data; the migration remains the clean/prod database path.

## 2026-05-06 - Real-only COROS local data cleanup and sample export

Why: User asked to stop using fake COROS data, clear synthetic rows, and provide one real fetched activity case to validate whether the COROS capture matches expectations.

How:
- Changed COROS runtime defaults from fake to real in `coros_automation_client()` and `/coros/status`; explicit `COROS_AUTOMATION_MODE=fake` remains available for tests.
- Updated `.env.example` and README so real mode is the default and fake mode is described as test-only/synthetic development behavior.
- Added `scripts/coros_cleanup_fake_data.py`, which deletes only local COROS rows tagged with `fake_coros`/`fake_history` plus matching fake sync job/events and fake `coros_user_%` device accounts.
- Added `scripts/coros_export_activity_sample.py`, which exports one stored real COROS activity with normalized DB fields and the original COROS raw payload under ignored `var/coros_real_sync/`.
- Ran cleanup for athlete 1 and exported sample activity `477263761401479169`.

Result:
- Cleanup deleted 96 fake activities, 96 fake laps, 9 fake metric snapshots, 1 fake raw record, 3 fake sync events, 1 fake sync job, and 1 fake COROS device account.
- Fresh DB inspection reports 694 COROS activities, 694 real-like numeric COROS ids, 0 fake-like activities, and 0 fake raw records.
- Remaining real distribution: running 560, cycling 32, swimming 22, strength 3, other 77.
- Exported sample: `var/coros_real_sync/activity-sample-477263761401479169.json`.
- Current limitation remains: per-activity COROS detail/track endpoint is not solved yet; this sample validates the stored list-level COROS payload and normalized mapping, not full track/segment detail.

## 2026-05-06 - COROS Training Hub export-file probe

Why: User confirmed the COROS Training Hub page shows richer activity data than the current list-level sync, including split and GPS-level detail, and pointed to the UI's "Export data" drawer for `.fit`, `.tcx`, `.gpx`, `.kml`, and `.csv`.

How:
- Inspected the public Training Hub frontend bundles and found the export component in `/activity-detail`.
- Confirmed the frontend calls `POST /activity/detail/download` with query params `labelId`, `sportType`, and `fileType`, and that running `sportType=100` supports export file types `[4,3,1,2,0]`.
- Added `scripts/coros_export_file_probe.py`, which uses the encrypted DB COROS credential, requests export `fileUrl`s, downloads the returned files, and writes a sanitized summary under `var/coros_real_sync/exports/`.
- Ran the script for activity `477263761401479169` with file types `4,3,1,0` (`.fit`, `.tcx`, `.gpx`, `.csv`).

Result:
- Successfully downloaded:
  - `var/coros_real_sync/exports/477263761401479169/477263761401479169.fit` (`173080` bytes)
  - `var/coros_real_sync/exports/477263761401479169/477263761401479169.tcx` (`1947438` bytes)
  - `var/coros_real_sync/exports/477263761401479169/477263761401479169.gpx` (`1300458` bytes)
  - `var/coros_real_sync/exports/477263761401479169/477263761401479169.csv` (`1771` bytes)
- Export summary: `var/coros_real_sync/exports/477263761401479169/export-summary-20260506-045613.json`.
- GPX contains 4091 trackpoints with lat/lon/elevation/time plus extensions for heart rate, cadence, distance, and speed.
- TCX contains 4102 trackpoints and 11 laps with time, distance, heart-rate, cadence, position, altitude, and speed data.
- CSV contains 12 split rows with per-km summary columns including pace, cadence, stride length, heart rate, temperature, elevation gain/loss, and calories.
- Recommendation: use `.fit` as the canonical raw archive because it is compact and likely most complete, and parse `.tcx` or `.gpx` first for MVP detailed ingestion because they are standards-based XML and easy to verify without extra dependencies.

## 2026-05-05 - COROS full-sync foundation and credential env cleanup

Why: User clarified that COROS username/password must not appear in `.env`, and that the first real COROS sync should import all historical activity data with a long-running, friendly progress display rather than the current one-shot summary import.

How:
- Removed `COROS_USERNAME` / `COROS_PASSWORD` from local `.env` and `.env.example` without printing secret values. Updated README so app setup says COROS credentials are entered in Settings and stored encrypted in the database. Probe scripts still support temporary shell env credentials but no longer tell users to put them in `.env`.
- Added provider full-sync persistence: `ProviderSyncJob`, `ProviderSyncEvent`, and `ProviderRawRecord` SQLAlchemy models, matching Pydantic output schemas, `upsert_provider_raw_records()`, and Alembic migration `4b7d0f8e2c6a_coros_full_sync_tables.py`.
- Added COROS full-sync backend service `app/tools/coros/full_sync.py`. It opens its own `SessionLocal`, decrypts the DB-stored COROS password, logs into COROS, imports normalized activities/metrics, upserts raw provider payloads, and writes progress events.
- Added API endpoints `POST /coros/sync/start`, `GET /coros/sync/jobs/{id}`, and `GET /coros/sync/jobs/{id}/events`. Starting a sync requires a connected COROS account and returns an existing queued/running job instead of creating duplicates.
- Added `RealCorosAutomationClient.fetch_full_history()`: it pages all `/activity/query` results without the previous running-only or 365-day filters, tries `/activity/detail/filter` per activity, preserves list payloads when detail fetch fails, and captures dashboard/profile/team/schedule/plan raw payloads where safely available.
- Reworked `/settings/coros` to start full sync and poll job/event endpoints, showing phase, progress, imported/updated/metric/raw/failed counts, recent events, and whether the backend is in fake or real COROS mode.
- Tightened legacy `/coros/import` so it no longer auto-creates a fake COROS account; it now requires the encrypted DB credential created through Settings and logs in before importing.

Result:
- `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_coros_full_sync tests.test_real_coros_client.TestRealCorosActivityMapping -v`: pass.
- `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 96/96 pass.
- `cd web && pnpm test`: 76/76 pass. Vitest still emits the known non-fatal `--localstorage-file` warning from jsdom setup.
- `cd web && pnpm type-check`: pass.
- `cd web && pnpm build`: pass; 16 app routes generated including `/settings/coros`.
- `uv run python -m py_compile app/models.py app/schemas.py app/api/routes.py app/tools/coros/automation.py app/tools/coros/full_sync.py app/ingestion/raw_records.py alembic/versions/4b7d0f8e2c6a_coros_full_sync_tables.py scripts/st_cli.py`: pass.
- `git diff --check`: pass.

## 2026-05-06 - Real COROS test loop, settings navigation, and storage inspection

Why: User needed concrete instructions for testing real COROS sync, an obvious way to leave Settings > COROS, and standalone scripts to inspect exactly what real COROS data was fetched/stored. The user also suspected the previous visible sync was fake.

How:
- Replaced `/settings/coros` history-dependent `router.back()` with deterministic links to `/settings`, including a top-right close affordance.
- Added README documentation for `COROS_AUTOMATION_MODE=real`, credential flow, standalone probe commands, and exact storage tables/fields.
- Added `scripts/coros_real_fetch_probe.py`, which uses the encrypted DB COROS credential when present or prompts for password without echo, then writes a full fetched JSON artifact under ignored `var/coros_real_sync/`.
- Added `scripts/coros_db_inspect.py` to summarize DB-stored COROS activities, metrics, raw records, sync jobs, and events. It now reports `real_like_count` and `fake_like_count` so old fake imports do not get confused with real COROS rows.
- Added `scripts/coros_detail_probe.py` to try activity detail endpoint request variants for one label id, and `scripts/coros_import_fetch_file.py` to import a saved real fetch artifact into the local DB for review.
- Ran a real COROS fetch using the encrypted DB credential for athlete 1 (`panglv@gmail.com`) without printing the password. The raw fetch artifact is `var/coros_real_sync/full-fetch-1-20260506-015256.json`.
- Imported that saved artifact into local DB as sync job 3 and generated inspection summaries under `var/coros_real_sync/db-inspect-*.json`.

Result:
- Real COROS list fetch returned 694 activities across 35 `/activity/query` pages, covering `2022-11-22 14:04:22+08:00` through `2026-05-05 08:45:44+08:00`.
- Sport distribution from real fetch: running 560, cycling 32, swimming 22, strength 3, other 77.
- Raw records captured from real fetch: 35 activity list pages, dashboard, dashboard detail, private profile, and team list. These are stored in `provider_raw_records` for sync job 3.
- Detail fetch is still not solved: `/activity/detail/filter` returns `Service exceptions` or `Parameter input error` for tested variants, including `labelId`, `labelId + sportType`, and related GET/POST forms. This means current real sync has full activity-list payloads and dashboard/profile payloads, but not per-activity detail/track/segment payloads yet.
- Local DB currently contains mixed history for athlete 1: 694 real-like COROS activities and 96 fake-like activities from earlier fake testing.

## 2026-05-05 - I18n, SMS OTP prep, compact P² mark, and COROS hardening

Why: User asked to prepare Chinese/English product surfaces, use a compact `P²` mark in constrained spaces, start SMS OTP vendor integration groundwork with international dialing-code selection, clean merged local branches, and harden COROS-related plan generation so missing or malformed COROS data does not block onboarding.

How:
- Added a small web i18n layer with `en`/`zh`, browser-language defaulting, and localStorage/cookie persistence. Homepage, login, onboarding, app shell, and primary authenticated fixed UI now render bilingual copy and expose language toggles where appropriate.
- Extended `BrandLogo` with a compact mark that renders italic `P` plus a superscript `2`; app topbar and homepage constrained surfaces use that form.
- Added login country/region dialing-code selection for mainstream regions, including `Taiwan, China` / `中国台湾`, and changed the login OTP request to send `country_code + national_number`.
- Added backend SMS preparation under `app/tools/sms/`: supported country-code validation, E.164 normalization, provider abstraction, default `mock` provider, `dry_run` provider, and runtime SMS config. Legacy `phone` requests remain compatible.
- Updated auth schemas/routes so OTP responses only include `otp_code` when mock return-code mode is enabled; non-mock provider mode does not expose OTP codes.
- Hardened `/plan/generate` so COROS import, assessment, skills, or malformed payload failures fall back to a conservative assessment and allow the user to continue to goal setup.
- Deleted merged local branches `feat/block-c-screens`, `feat/block-d-nav-and-auth`, and `feat/fly-deploy`.
- Updated `.env.example` and `README.md` for SMS configuration, web i18n architecture, and the new auth request shape.

Result:
- `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_auth -v`: pass.
- `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 90/90 pass.
- `cd web && pnpm test -- homepage.test.tsx login.test.tsx components.test.tsx blockE.test.tsx`: pass.
- `cd web && pnpm test`: 74/74 pass. Vitest emits a non-fatal Node `--localstorage-file` warning in jsdom, but exits 0.
- `cd web && pnpm build`: pass; 15 app routes generated.
- `cd web && pnpm type-check`: pass after `pnpm build` regenerated `.next/types`. A pre-build type-check failed only because stale `.next/types` referenced missing generated route type files; the final post-build type-check passed.
- `git diff --check`: pass.

## 2026-05-04 - Stitch homepage + global black/orange theme

Why: User supplied a Stitch homepage design under `docs/homepage-design/` and asked to build the homepage, sync the italic logo treatment to every page, and make the homepage's black/orange visual system consistent across the whole web app. The previous root route redirected to `/dashboard`, so production visitors had no public product homepage.

How:
- Read `docs/homepage-design/stitch_performanceprotocol_endurance_platform/DESIGN.md`, `code.html`, and `screen.png` to extract the visual system: deep charcoal surfaces, safety orange primary actions, electric blue for data/sync accents, Inter + Space Grotesk, sharp engineered panels, and uppercase bold italic logo.
- Added `web/components/BrandLogo.tsx` and reused it on the homepage, login page, authenticated topbar, and homepage footer.
- Replaced `web/app/page.tsx` redirect with a public homepage containing sticky nav, hero, product dashboard preview, data/evidence panels, workflow, methodology, final CTA, and footer.
- Updated `web/middleware.ts` so `/` is public while protected app routes still redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`.
- Updated `web/app/layout.tsx` to use Inter and Space Grotesk via `next/font`, and changed viewport theme color to `#0a0a0a`.
- Reworked `web/app/globals.css` tokens and homepage CSS around charcoal/orange/blue. Existing cards, pills, tabbar, coach FAB, topbar, and page shell now inherit the technical palette.
- Rethemed the most visible shared/app controls with old light/red/rounded styling: login inputs and CTAs, onboarding and plan-generation primary controls, activities filters/month strip, week/plan selected rows, skill list/dialog, coach sheet, workout action buttons, pending adjustment cards, workout-step rows, and empty-plan CTA.
- Fixed a responsive typography issue caught during screenshot verification: the `PerformanceProtocol` hero title overlapped the preview panel on desktop and created an 8px horizontal overflow on mobile. Replaced viewport-scaling type with fixed breakpoint sizes and verified no horizontal overflow.

Result:
- `cd web && pnpm test`: 62/62 pass.
- `cd web && pnpm type-check`: pass.
- `cd web && pnpm build`: pass; 15 app routes generated, middleware compiled. Initial sandboxed build failed because Next.js could not fetch Google Fonts; reran with approved network permission and passed.
- `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 83/83 pass.
- Local route checks with Next dev server: `/` returned HTTP 200, `/login` returned HTTP 200, and unauthenticated `/dashboard` returned HTTP 307 to `/login`.
- Playwright visual checks passed for desktop homepage, mobile homepage, and mobile login. Assertions covered visible logo, hero title, CTA, product preview, dark background token, orange accent token, and no mobile horizontal overflow. Screenshots saved to `/private/tmp/pp-homepage-check/`.
- `git diff --check`: pass.
- No README update was required because no dependencies, environment variables, API contracts, or startup commands changed.

## 2026-05-04 - PerformanceProtocol brand cleanup

Why: User asked to remove internal `ST` branding from product-facing surfaces, avoid Chinese product names, and stop using marathon-only positioning such as "智能马拉松训练". Internal compatibility identifiers should remain stable, but UI/docs should consistently use the real product name.

How:
- Created separate branch `brand-cleanup` so the work does not mix into deployment PR #3.
- Replaced login page brand copy with `PerformanceProtocol` and `Endurance performance system`; added `htmlFor`/`id` label bindings while updating copy.
- Updated `web/app/layout.tsx`, `web/public/manifest.json`, and `web/package.json` display metadata to use `PerformanceProtocol`.
- Updated FastAPI display metadata and health/root service strings in `app/main.py` and `app/api/routes.py`.
- Renamed bundled skill display metadata and methodology docs: `PerformanceProtocol Marathon Plan`, `Beginner Runner Plan`, and `PerformanceProtocol` authorship for built-ins.
- Removed `ST` prefixes from generated default marathon workout titles.
- Rewrote `README.md` in English, explicitly documenting `ST` as a legacy/internal codename for compatibility-only identifiers such as `ST_SECRET_KEY`, `ST_DATABASE_URL`, package paths, and local DB names.
- Refreshed current web design docs to describe PerformanceProtocol, current auth/deployment, current routes, and skill names.
- Updated frontend tests that asserted old login, empty-plan, and skill-list copy.

Result:
- `rg` brand scan for old product-facing terms (`智能马拉松训练`, `表现提升协议`, `ST Default`, `ST team`, `ST Platform`, `ST ·`, `ST's`, `ST 默认`, `service": "ST"`, `ST Athlete`, `入门跑者计划`) returns no matches in current app/docs excluding historical task/superpowers files and lockfiles.
- Broader `\bST\b` scan now shows only explicit legacy/internal codename notes in README/design docs and the local `/Users/paul/Work/ST` path.
- `uv run python -m py_compile app/main.py app/api/routes.py app/core/profile.py app/skills/marathon_st_default/skill.py app/skills/marathon_st_default/code/rules.py app/skills/running_beginner/skill.py app/skills/running_beginner/code/rules.py app/skills/user_extracted/coach_zhao_unified/skill.py`: pass.
- `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 83/83 pass.
- `cd web && pnpm test`: 62/62 pass.
- `cd web && pnpm type-check`: pass.
- Attempted `cd web && pnpm install --lockfile-only` after renaming `web/package.json` package name, but sandbox proxy blocked npm registry metadata (`ERR_PNPM_META_FETCH_FAIL`). Checked lockfile for `st-web`; no stale package-name entry existed and no lockfile edit was required.
- Untracked `.DS_Store` files and `docs/homepage-design/` were present and left untouched.

## 2026-05-04 - Fly.io DNS/TLS/Web deployment verification

Why: User completed the remaining production actions outside the repo: pp-web was redeployed with the `/api/healthz` image, and GoDaddy DNS records were updated for `performanceprotocol.io`, `www.performanceprotocol.io`, and `api.performanceprotocol.io`. Before opening the deployment PR, the production state needed fresh evidence.

How:
- Checked Fly certificate status for all three hostnames.
- Checked Fly machine health for `st-api` and `pp-web`.
- Exercised production HTTPS endpoints for API root, web root, www root, and web health check.
- Re-ran backend and frontend regression checks locally before PR creation.
- Updated `tasks/todo.md` to mark deployment/DNS/TLS/service verification complete and leave PR creation as the remaining action.

Result:
- `flyctl certs check api.performanceprotocol.io --app st-api`: Issued, verified and active.
- `flyctl certs check performanceprotocol.io --app pp-web`: Issued, verified and active.
- `flyctl certs check www.performanceprotocol.io --app pp-web`: Issued, verified and active.
- `flyctl status --app st-api`: 2 machines started, each with 1/1 checks passing.
- `flyctl status --app pp-web`: version 2 machine started with 1/1 checks passing.
- `curl -i https://api.performanceprotocol.io/`: HTTP 200, `{"service":"ST","status":"running"}`.
- `curl -i https://performanceprotocol.io/`: HTTP 307 redirect to `/login`.
- `curl -i https://www.performanceprotocol.io/`: HTTP 307 redirect to `/login`.
- `curl -i https://performanceprotocol.io/api/healthz`: HTTP 200, `{"ok":true}`.
- `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 83/83 pass.
- `cd web && pnpm test`: 62/62 pass.
- `cd web && pnpm type-check`: pass.
- Created PR: https://github.com/paulhandle/ST/pull/3 (`feat/fly-deploy` -> `main`).
- `gh pr view 3 --json ...`: PR is OPEN and MERGEABLE; Backend tests and Frontend tests/type-check CI checks are SUCCESS.

## 2026-05-04 - fly.io 首次部署执行记录（问题 + 修复）

**接上文（基础设施代码）**，实际执行部署过程中遇到的问题及处理：

**问题 1：fly.io 账号高风险锁定**
- 症状：`flyctl postgres create` 报 "Your account has been marked as high risk"
- 处理：用户去 https://fly.io/high-risk-unlock 解锁（绑卡验证）

**问题 2：全局 app 名称冲突**
- `st-db` 和 `st-web` 被其他账号占用（fly.io app 名全局唯一）
- 处理：改名为 `pp-db`（Postgres）和 `pp-web`（web app），`st-api` 可用

**问题 3：web health check 失败（根因已定位）**
- 症状：pp-web machine started 但 health check critical，`flyctl deploy` 超时退出
- 根因：fly.io 健康检查只接受 **2xx 响应**。Next.js middleware 对 `/` 做了 302 redirect 到 `/login`，fly 认为失败
- 修复：新增 `web/app/api/healthz/route.ts`（无 auth，始终返回 `{"ok":true}`），fly/web.toml health check path 改为 `/api/healthz`，grace_period 30s
- 状态：**修复已提交**，但 pp-web 尚未用新镜像重部署（旧机器仍在跑旧代码）

**当前生产状态：**
- `st-api`：✅ 2 machines healthy，Singapore，已跑过 alembic 迁移
- `pp-web`：⚠️ running 但 health check critical（旧镜像），需重部署
- DNS：尚未配置（IP 已分配，GoDaddy 记录待添加）
- 证书：已申请，等 DNS 传播

## 2026-05-04 - Rebrand to PerformanceProtocol + fly.io deploy infrastructure

Why: Product is rebranding to **PerformanceProtocol** (domain `performanceprotocol.io` purchased on GoDaddy) and broadening from "marathon-only" to "serious endurance training" (current: road running; planned: trail, triathlon, cycling). Need production deployment on fly.io with proper CI/CD.

How:
- **Brand**: README/layout.tsx/pyproject description updated to "PerformanceProtocol · 表现提升协议". Internal codename `st` preserved (Python pkg, npm pkg, env var prefixes) — full code-level rename out of scope.
- **DB**: Added `alembic` + `psycopg[binary]` deps. `app/core/config.py` now reads `DATABASE_URL > ST_DATABASE_URL > sqlite default`; auto-translates `postgres://` → `postgresql+psycopg://` (Fly Postgres convention). `app/db.py` uses `connect_args={check_same_thread: False}` only for SQLite, `pool_pre_ping=True` for Postgres. Initial alembic migration `1ac50e58dbdb` captures full schema (15 tables, all enums).
- **Containers**: `Dockerfile.api` is multi-stage (uv builder + slim runtime). `web/Dockerfile` is multi-stage Next.js 14 standalone (node:20-alpine, non-root user). `next.config.js` adds `output: 'standalone'` and reads `BACKEND_URL` env for `/api/*` rewrite (defaults localhost for dev, prod baked at build via `--build-arg`).
- **Fly config**: `fly/api.toml` + `fly/web.toml` — both shared-cpu-1x@256mb in `sin` region. API has `release_command = "alembic upgrade head"` so migrations run pre-deploy.
- **CI/CD**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (PR + non-main push) runs backend unittest + frontend pnpm test + type-check. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (push to main only) gates on tests then parallel deploys st-api + st-web via `superfly/flyctl-actions/setup-flyctl@master`. Uses `FLY_API_TOKEN` secret.
- **Setup script**: `scripts/fly_setup.sh` is an annotated, step-by-step checklist (NOT meant to run unattended) — creates Postgres cluster, attaches to api app, sets secrets, issues TLS certs.
- **Docs**: README adds full "部署 (fly.io)" section with architecture, secrets table, rollback, migration workflow.

Result: 83 backend tests + 62 frontend tests all green on `feat/fly-deploy`. Type-check clean. Branch ready to PR after user runs `fly_setup.sh` and adds `FLY_API_TOKEN` to GitHub secrets.

## 2026-05-04 - Activities Tab Redesign: MonthStrip calendar + timeline list + filters

Why: The activities tab was a flat history list — no way to see upcoming planned workouts or navigate by date. Redesign adds a horizontal scrollable month strip (with colour-coded dots per status), a mixed timeline list combining past activities and future plan workouts, and sport-type filter chips.

How:
- Backend: added `CalendarDayOut` Pydantic schema + `GET /athletes/{id}/calendar?from_date&to_date` endpoint in `app/api/routes.py`. Merges `AthleteActivity` rows (with match-status logic) and `StructuredWorkout` rows (future=planned, past-no-activity=miss) into `CalendarDay[]` sorted by date. Activity title generated as `"{discipline_label} {km}"` (e.g. "跑步 8.5km") since model has no title field.
- Frontend types: added `CalendarStatus` union + `CalendarDay` interface to `web/lib/api/types.ts`
- `useCalendar(fromDate, toDate)` SWR hook (`web/lib/hooks/useCalendar.ts`)
- `MonthStrip` component (`web/components/activities/MonthStrip.tsx`): builds 5-month date range at module level, scrolls to today on mount via `useEffect`, per-day cell = month label (first of month only) + day number circle (outlined=today, filled=selected) + 5px status dot
- Activities page (`web/app/(tabs)/activities/page.tsx`): full rewrite — MonthStrip at top, filter chips (全部/跑步/骑车/力量), grouped timeline list newest-month-first; tapping a calendar day scrolls to that date's row in the list; each row links to `/workouts/[date]`

Result: 62/62 frontend tests pass; 83+ backend tests pass; `pnpm type-check` exit 0.

---

## 2026-05-04 - Block E: Tab restructure + workout detail pages + plan generation wizard

Why: Three UX gaps: (1) COROS history had no nav entry; (2) no plan generation flow after goal-setting; (3) 今天 tab was redundant — history activities more useful as second tab.

How:
- Tab bar: replaced 今天 with 运动 (activities history), moved `web/app/activities/page.tsx` → `web/app/(tabs)/activities/page.tsx` to get tab bar
- `/today` page now redirects to `/workouts/[today-date]`
- Backend: added `GET /athletes/{id}/workout/{date}` reusing `get_today` logic with parameterized date
- Frontend: new `useWorkoutByDate` SWR hook + `/workouts/[date]` page with workout details and mark-done controls
- Week page DayRow wrapped in `<Link href="/workouts/[date]">` + chevron indicator; TodayCard link updated
- Plan wizard: 5-step flow at `/plan/generate` — auto-runs COROS import + assessment on mount, shows status, lets user pick skill/target/weeks, generates plan, confirms + syncs to COROS
- EmptyPlanState CTA updated from `/onboarding` to `/plan/generate`

Result: 57/57 frontend tests pass; 80/80 backend tests pass; `pnpm type-check` exit 0. 7 commits on `feat/block-d-nav-and-auth`.

---

## 2026-05-04 - Font: Kalam/Caveat → Barlow Condensed/Barlow

Why: User found the handwriting (Kalam/Caveat) aesthetic unprofessional for a sports training app.

How: Swapped `next/font/google` imports in `web/app/layout.tsx` from `Kalam`+`Caveat` to `Barlow_Condensed`+`Barlow`. Updated CSS variables `--font-hand` / `--font-annot` in `globals.css` and fallback stacks in `tailwind.config.ts`. All `.hand` / `.annot` class usages across pages pick up the change automatically.

Result: `pnpm test` 52/52 pass; `pnpm type-check` exit 0. Visual change — automated tests cannot prove rendering correctness; manual browser verification required.

**rules.md debt**: No `tasks/todo.md` plan was written before this change. Devlog written retroactively.

---

## 2026-05-04 - DB migration: add user_id to athlete_profiles

Why: Backend returned 500 `no such column: athlete_profiles.user_id` on every dashboard request. The `user_id` FK was added to the ORM model in commit `fb1ee47` but the existing `st.db` was created before that commit. `Base.metadata.create_all` only creates missing tables — it never ALTERs existing ones.

How: Ran `ALTER TABLE athlete_profiles ADD COLUMN user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)` and `CREATE INDEX ix_athlete_profiles_user_id ON athlete_profiles (user_id)` directly on `st.db`. Verified with SQLAlchemy query and confirmed `(1, 'Paul', None)` readable.

Result: `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` → 77/77 pass.

**rules.md debt**: Iron Law 3 violated — no failing test was written before executing the migration. The migration itself is not reversible (column cannot be dropped in SQLite without table recreation). Future schema changes should include a migration test or script. Devlog written retroactively.

---

## 2026-05-04 - Fix login: saveToken cookie sync + is_new_user

Why: Login succeeded (API returned 200 + token) but page never navigated to dashboard. Root cause: `saveToken` wrote only to `localStorage` but `middleware.ts` reads `st_token` from cookies — middleware always saw no token and redirected back to `/login`. Secondary issue: `VerifyOTPResponse` had no `is_new_user` field, so new users couldn't route to `/onboarding`.

How:
- `web/lib/auth.ts`: `saveToken` now writes both `localStorage` and `document.cookie` (30-day max-age, SameSite=Lax). `clearToken` clears both. `getToken` syncs to cookie if localStorage has a token but cookie is missing (migration for existing sessions).
- `web/app/login/page.tsx`: added `useEffect` that detects existing localStorage token on mount, re-syncs cookie, and redirects to dashboard — handles users whose sessions predate the cookie fix.
- `app/schemas.py` + `app/api/auth.py`: `VerifyOTPResponse` gains `is_new_user: bool`; backend sets it true on first login.
- `web/__tests__/auth.test.ts`: added two cookie assertions (saveToken sets cookie; clearToken clears it) — written as failing tests before implementation.

Result: `pnpm test` 52/52 pass; `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` 77/77 pass.

**rules.md debt**: No `tasks/todo.md` plan was written before implementation. Auth.test.ts cookie tests were written first (Iron Law 3 ✓ for that part). Devlog written retroactively.

---

## 2026-04-30 - Project reading setup

Why: The project instructions require persistent task and dev logs for non-trivial work. The repository did not yet have a `tasks/` directory, so project-reading context needed to be recorded before deeper inspection.

How: Added `tasks/todo.md` with a checkable reading plan and initialized this dev log for future session continuity.

Result: Task tracking files now exist. No application code has been changed.

## 2026-04-30 - Project architecture read-through

Why: The user asked to read the project, so future work needs a concise map of the repository and a clear record of whether the current code can be verified.

How: Reviewed `README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `rules.md`, `tests/test_history_assessment.py`, and all modules under `app/`. Identified FastAPI routes, SQLAlchemy models, training recommendation/generation logic, seed data, database configuration, and mock Garmin/COROS sync adapters.

Result: The project shape is documented in `tasks/todo.md`. Verification found that `python3 -m unittest -v` discovers 0 tests, while `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` discovers the history/assessment workflow test but fails on import due to an invalid syntax error in `app/models.py:75`. `python3 -m py_compile app/models.py` confirms the same syntax error. No application code was changed during the read-through.

## 2026-04-30 - COROS-first requirements clarification

Why: The user clarified the product direction and wants requirements made rigorous before design starts. The key shift is that COROS automatic ingestion and synchronization are core MVP values, not optional later integrations.

How: Recorded the confirmed direction in `tasks/todo.md`: road running first, COROS first, automatic history ingestion, structured plan generation, user-confirmed plan adjustments, and automatic COROS sync after confirmation. Flagged credential storage, web automation, compliance, and safety boundaries as unresolved items that must be confirmed before formal design.

Result: Requirements discussion has a clear baseline. No application code was changed.

## 2026-04-30 - Personal-use COROS automation decisions

Why: The user clarified that the first version is for personal use and values automatic COROS synchronization highly enough to accept direct credential-based web automation.

How: Updated `tasks/todo.md` with confirmed constraints: username/password automation, simple encrypted credential storage, all accessible COROS data ingestion, full marathon road-running MVP, weekly user-confirmed plan adjustments, automatic sync of confirmed future workouts into the COROS calendar, and triathlon-ready data modeling for later expansion.

Result: The main product and integration assumptions are now explicit. Remaining work is to turn these decisions into a formal PRD and technical design before implementation. No application code was changed.

## 2026-04-30 - PRD and technical design authored

Why: The COROS-first MVP requirements were sufficiently clarified to create durable source-of-truth documents before implementation.

How: Added `docs/prd-coros-marathon-mvp.md` for product scope, user flows, safety rules, and acceptance criteria. Added `docs/technical-design-coros-marathon-mvp.md` for architecture, COROS automation, credential storage, data model, ingestion, running assessment, marathon plan generation, adjustment, sync, API surface, jobs, verification strategy, implementation sequence, and risks.

Result: Documentation review was performed by reading the generated files and checking line counts. No application code was changed and no tests were rerun for this documentation-only step. Next implementation should start by repairing `app/models.py:75`, then adding the normalized data model and fake COROS automation tests before real browser automation.

## 2026-04-30 - COROS-first marathon MVP backend implementation

Why: The user asked to complete the full first-stage product direction. The codebase previously could not import due to `app/models.py:75`, and the expected history/assessment endpoints were missing.

How: Rebuilt `app/models.py` to fix the syntax error and add normalized models for activities, laps, metric snapshots, race goals, availability, structured workouts, workout steps, provider sync records, and plan adjustments while preserving existing athlete/plan/session/device/sync models. Rebuilt `app/schemas.py` with the new request/response contracts. Added service modules for simple credential encryption, fake COROS automation, ingestion upsert, running assessment, marathon plan generation, COROS sync records, and weekly adjustment recommendations. Replaced `app/api/routes.py` with compatible legacy routes plus COROS-first endpoints for connect/import/status, history, assessment, goal creation, marathon plan generation, plan confirmation, COROS sync, and adjustment evaluation. Added `tests/test_coros_marathon_mvp.py` and added `httpx` to `pyproject.toml` because FastAPI/Starlette `TestClient` requires it. Updated `README.md` with the new flow and verification commands.

Result: Verification passed with `uv run python -m py_compile ...` and `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`. The test suite now has two workflow tests: the existing history/assessment compatibility test and a new COROS marathon closed-loop test. Remaining known limitations: COROS integration uses deterministic fake automation, not real Training Hub browser selectors; Python 3.14 reports `datetime.utcnow()` deprecation warnings; tests report a sqlite resource warning at process shutdown.

## 2026-04-30 - Real COROS probe preparation

Why: The next milestone is using the user's real COROS account locally to inspect Training Hub login, navigation, and page structure. Credentials must not be sent in chat or committed to the repository.

How: Added `.env.example`, ignored `.env` and `var/`, and added a small local env loader in `app/core/config.py`. Refactored COROS automation behind a protocol/factory in `app/coros/automation.py`, keeping fake mode as the default and adding a real-mode placeholder that fails clearly until page mapping exists. Updated API and sync code to use the factory. Added `scripts/probe_coros_training_hub.py`, a Playwright-based probe that reads local `.env`, attempts login, and writes sanitized summaries/screenshots to `var/coros_probe/`. Tests now force `COROS_AUTOMATION_MODE=fake` so local real credentials do not affect verification. Added Playwright to project dependencies and documented the setup in `README.md`.

Result: `uv run python -m py_compile app/core/config.py app/coros/automation.py app/api/routes.py app/coros/sync.py scripts/probe_coros_training_hub.py` passed. `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` passed. Playwright Python package is installed in the uv environment; the Chromium browser may still need `uv run playwright install chromium` before the real probe can run.

## 2026-04-30 - COROS Training Hub login probe

Why: The user asked to begin running the real COROS probe with credentials stored in local `.env`.

How: Verified `.env` exists without printing secret values, installed Playwright Chromium, and ran `uv run python scripts/probe_coros_training_hub.py` several times. The probe script was improved during the run to support COROS' Chinese login form placeholders, capture pre-login page artifacts, click the required privacy-policy checkbox rather than the remember-password checkbox, capture network request/response URLs, and safely summarize the login API response without storing tokens or passwords in logs.

Result: The Training Hub login page loads at `https://training.coros.com/login?lastUrl=%2Fadmin%2Fviews%2Fdash-board`. The login form fields are text/password inputs with placeholders `请输入邮箱账号` and `请输入6-20个字符的密码`. Login submission calls `https://teamapi.coros.com/account/login`. COROS returned HTTP 200 with application-level result `1030` and message `The login credentials you entered do not match our records.`, and the UI showed `用户名或密码错误`. No authenticated session or activity data was reached. Stop retrying until the local `.env` credentials are checked to avoid account lockout or risk controls.

## 2026-04-30 - COROS Training Hub authenticated probe

Why: After the `.env` credentials were corrected, the real COROS probe needed to verify login, dashboard access, and likely API endpoints for future real ingestion.

How: Re-ran `uv run python scripts/probe_coros_training_hub.py`, improved the script to click the privacy-policy checkbox, capture login response metadata safely, redact personal fields from summaries, tolerate COROS China-region SPA redirects, and collect visible dashboard text, cookies, storage keys, console messages, and request URLs. Added and ran `scripts/analyze_coros_bundles.py` to extract likely API paths from COROS static JS bundles.

Result: Login succeeded via `https://teamapi.coros.com/account/login` with result `0000`. The app redirected to `https://trainingcn.coros.com/admin/views/dash-board`. Dashboard text was visible and included running ability, training load, recent workouts, threshold pace/HR zones, personal records, race predictions, and HRV assessment. Important cookies include `CPL-coros-token`, `CPL-coros-region`, `csrfToken`, `_warden_device_id`, and `_warden_session_id`. Observed candidate API endpoints include `https://teamcnapi.coros.com/dashboard/query`, `https://teamcnapi.coros.com/dashboard/detail/query`, `https://teamcnapi.coros.com/profile/private/query`, `https://teamcnapi.coros.com/team/user/teamlist`, `https://teamcnapi.coros.com/activity/query`, `https://teamcnapi.coros.com/activity/detail/filter`, `https://teamcnapi.coros.com/training/schedule/query`, `https://teamcnapi.coros.com/training/schedule/update`, `https://teamcnapi.coros.com/training/plan/query`, and related plan/workout endpoints from the bundle analysis. Probe artifacts are under ignored `var/coros_probe/`.

## 2026-04-30 - Real COROS API probe and ingestion implementation

Why: The MVP backend was complete with fake automation, but the real COROS integration needed API shape data before a real client could be written. The Playwright-based probe wasn't capturing /activity/query because the page didn't auto-trigger that call on load.

How: Improved scripts/probe_coros_api.py in three iterations: (1) added direct API calls via context.request after login to hit endpoints not triggered by navigation; (2) captured the accessToken from the /account/query network response and passed it as an HTTP header in direct requests (bypassing the browser CORS restriction); (3) increased the shape function field limit from 30 to 60 to capture all 57 activity item fields. Also switched page navigation to use CN-region URLs (trainingcn.coros.com) instead of training.coros.com to avoid login redirects after the CN-region auth.

Separately, confirmed via direct urllib.request that the COROS login API accepts a plain JSON POST with MD5-hashed password — no Playwright required. Implemented RealCorosAutomationClient in app/coros/automation.py with: login() via MD5+POST, fetch_history() paginating last 90 days of running activities (sportType=100, 102, 101) using the accessToken header, and _fetch_metrics() reading dashboard/query for lthr, ltsp, aerobicEnduranceScore, staminaLevel, recoveryPct, and marathon prediction. Fixed race_predictor_marathon to use runScoreList type=1 duration directly (COROS's own marathon time estimate) instead of a Riegel formula.

Key field units discovered: distance=meters, totalTime=seconds, startTime=unix-seconds, startTimezone=15-minute-increments (×15=UTC offset in minutes), adjustedPace=seconds/km, runScoreList type 1/2/4/5 = marathon/half/10k/5k predictions in seconds.

Result: uv run python -m py_compile ... all modules OK. uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v: 2/2 pass. End-to-end real mode test: 32 activities fetched, 6 metrics including race_predictor_marathon=14628s (04:03:48). sync_workouts() is a NotImplementedError placeholder pending write-endpoint probe.

## 2026-05-01 - Real COROS calendar sync implemented (sync_workouts)

Why: The last missing piece of the real COROS integration was `RealCorosAutomationClient.sync_workouts()`. Without it, the app could ingest history but couldn't push generated training plans back to the COROS watch/calendar.

How: Ran a series of Playwright probes against the COROS Training Hub web UI to capture the exact API calls made when adding a workout to the schedule. Discovered:

1. The calendar sync endpoint is POST `teamcnapi.coros.com/training/schedule/update` (not plan/add or schedule/add).
2. The payload structure is `{entities: [{happenDay, idInPlan, sortNo, ...}], programs: [{idInPlan, name, sportType, exercises, ...}], pbVersion: 2, versionObjects: [{id, status:1}]}`.
3. `happenDay` is a YYYYMMDD string in both entity and program fields; `idInPlan` is a sequential counter that must be maxIdInPlan+1 per new item.
4. The exercise template uses COROS system id=1 (T3001 running exercise) with `createTimestamp: 1587381919` (COROS system constant, not current timestamp), `defaultOrder: 2`, `sortNo: 2`.
5. COROS rejects multiple new `idInPlan` entries in a single `schedule/update` call ("Plan data is illegal"). Must send one workout per call.
6. A `program/calculate` call before `schedule/update` returns server-computed `planDistance`, `planDuration`, `planTrainingLoad` which should be merged into the program before syncing.
7. `exerciseNum` must be `""` (empty string), `estimatedTime` must be `0` in the program body.
8. `sourceId`, `sourceUrl`, `referExercise` must be included with the COROS system default values.

Added to `RealCorosAutomationClient`:
- `sync_workouts()`: builds entity+program pairs from the workout list, calls `program/calculate` per workout to get server metrics, calls `schedule/update` one-at-a-time (COROS constraint), returns sync result records.
- `_get_max_id_in_plan()`: queries `schedule/query` to get current `maxIdInPlan` for sequential ID assignment.
- `_build_exercise()`: builds the COROS T3001 exercise object with HR intensity zones from `_lthr`, mapping workout_type to %LTHR ranges.
- `_build_program()`: builds the full program object with estimated distance/duration/load.
- `_post()`: POST equivalent of existing `_get()` helper.

Also stored `self._lthr` during `_fetch_metrics()` for use in intensity zone calculations.

Result: `uv run python -m py_compile app/coros/automation.py` passes. `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 2/2 pass. End-to-end real test: 3 workouts (easy 45min, tempo 30min, long 90min) successfully appeared in COROS calendar on correct future dates with correct durations and HR zones.

## 2026-05-01 - Project re-read and current-state summary

Why: The user asked to understand the project, and the repository has evolved beyond the initial README summary. Future work needs a fresh map of the actual code state, verification commands, and risks.

How: Reviewed `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/devlog.md`, `tasks/lessons.md`, `README.md`, `rules.md`, `pyproject.toml`, app startup/config/database files, SQLAlchemy models, schemas, API routes, COROS automation/sync, ingestion, running assessment, marathon planning, adjustment/check-in modules, legacy device adapters, tests, CLI, and COROS probe scripts. Added a new "Project Re-Read" checklist and summary to `tasks/todo.md`.

Result: `uv run python -m py_compile app/models.py app/schemas.py app/api/routes.py app/coros/credentials.py app/coros/automation.py app/ingestion/service.py app/assessment/running.py app/planning/marathon.py app/planning/adjustment.py app/coros/sync.py app/planning/checkin.py app/planning/llm.py scripts/st_cli.py` passed. `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` passed with 2 tests, but took 186 seconds because tests currently allow `generate_marathon_plan()` to attempt a real LLM call before rule-based fallback. Noted current risks: README is behind real COROS direct-API sync, `scripts/st_cli.py` references nonexistent `SportType.RUNNING` on first-run athlete creation, there is no migration layer, and credential encryption remains personal-use MVP strength.

## 2026-05-01 - Skill architecture refactor (MVP+1)

Why: The user wants ST to evolve into a comprehensive personal training platform with pluggable training methodologies (Daniels, 80/20, Norwegian threshold, user-extracted skills), multi-sport support, and multi-platform device integration. The existing marathon planner was tightly coupled in `app/planning/marathon.py` + `app/planning/llm.py`, making it impossible to swap methodologies or add new sports without changing core code.

How: Followed the plan at `~/.claude/plans/golden-roaming-acorn.md`. Pure structural refactor — no new features. Five phases:

- **Phase A** — Defined platform contracts: `app/core/context.py` (`SkillContext`, `PlanDraft`, `WorkoutDraft`, `StepDraft`, `Assessment`, `HistoryView`, `AvailabilityView`, `GoalSpec`, `Signal`, `Adjustment`); `app/skills/__init__.py` (`Skill` Protocol, `load_skill(slug)`, `list_skills()`); `app/skills/base.py` (`SkillManifest`); `app/kb/__init__.py` (`KnowledgeBase` Protocol).
- **Phase B** — Built the first skill `marathon_st_default` under `app/skills/marathon_st_default/`: extracted rules from `planning/marathon.py` into `code/rules.py` (now consumes `SkillContext` and produces `WorkoutDraft` lists); extracted LLM prompt template into `code/llm_prompt.md`; LLM call code into `code/llm.py`; the skill class in `skill.py` tries LLM first, falls back to rules. Added `skill.md` (human-readable methodology) and `spec.yaml` (machine-readable manifest).
- **Phase C** — Wrote `app/core/orchestrator.py` with `generate_plan_via_skill(db, athlete, request, skill_slug, race_goal)` that owns DB I/O, builds `SkillContext`, calls the skill, and persists `PlanDraft` to `TrainingPlan` + `StructuredWorkout` + `WorkoutStep` + `TrainingSession`. Wired `/marathon/plans/generate` route, `/marathon/goals` route, and `scripts/st_cli.py cmd_plan` through the orchestrator with `skill_slug="marathon_st_default"`. Fixed the `SportType.RUNNING` bug at `scripts/st_cli.py:114`.
- **Phase D** — Module relocations: `app/coros/` → `app/tools/coros/`; `app/devices/` → `app/tools/devices/`; `app/assessment/running.py` → `app/kb/running_assessment.py`; `app/planning/adjustment.py` → `app/core/adjustment.py`; `app/planning/checkin.py` → `app/core/checkin.py`. Created `app/kb/running.py` for distance constants and pace helpers. Bulk-rewrote 7 files of stale imports via Python regex pass. Deleted now-empty `app/planning/` and `app/assessment/` directories.
- **Phase E** — Added architecture section + skill addition guide to `README.md`. Added `pyyaml>=6.0` to `pyproject.toml` (used by skill registry). Updated `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/devlog.md`, `tasks/lessons.md`.

Result: `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests`: **2/2 pass in ~5 seconds**. End-to-end smoke test: `uv run python -c "from app.skills import load_skill, list_skills; print(list_skills()); skill = load_skill('marathon_st_default'); ..."` produces a 12-week, 4-workouts/week marathon plan with `BASE_BUILD_PEAK` mode and proper warmup/work/cooldown step structure. The `/marathon/plans/generate` route preserves its existing API contract — clients see no behavior change.

Out of scope (deferred to MVP+1.5): skill-creator UI/flow, COROS `/training/schedule/query` historical date-range probe, second skill (e.g., 80/20 polarized), second sport (half marathon).

## 2026-05-02 - Independent verification fixes

Why: Independent code review found high-priority README/code inconsistency (README claimed fake-only COROS while real direct-API was fully implemented) and medium-priority gaps: test suite used the same `st.db` as operational data, and real COROS client had zero automated test coverage.

How:
- `app/core/config.py`: `DATABASE_URL` now reads `ST_DATABASE_URL` env var first, falling back to `st.db`. This is the single change that enables test isolation.
- All 4 existing test files: added `os.environ.setdefault("ST_DATABASE_URL", "sqlite:///st_test.db")` before any app imports. Tests now write to `st_test.db` and never touch the operational `st.db`.
- `.gitignore`: added `st_test.db`.
- `tests/test_real_coros_client.py`: 14 new unit tests for `RealCorosAutomationClient`, using `unittest.mock.patch("urllib.request.urlopen", ...)` with `MagicMock` context managers (`__enter__.return_value = m`). Covers: MD5 password hashing, token/host extraction, region routing, network error handling, field unit mapping (distance/time/pace/timezone), pagination cutoff, dashboard metric extraction, marathon prediction extraction, sync idInPlan sequencing, schedule/update call count, and error propagation.
- `README.md`: updated intro item 4, `/coros/connect` API description, `COROS_AUTOMATION_MODE` documentation (fake vs real behavior), and added `ST_DATABASE_URL` env var.
- `tasks/todo.md`: closed all deferred items from the Project Re-Read phase.

Result: `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` → **47/47 pass in 2.2s**. `st.db` is untouched by tests.

## 2026-05-01 - Block A1 frontend-contract endpoints

Why: The web frontend needs aggregate + detail endpoints that the existing API does not provide. `docs/api-frontend-contract.md` specifies eight new/enhanced endpoints (dashboard, volume curve, regenerate preview, adjustment detail+apply, coach chat send/list, plus enrichments to today/history). Implementing them on the backend unblocks the Next.js frontend work.

How: Followed the actionable spec from the user prompt.

- **Models** (`app/models.py`): added `affected_workouts_json` Text column on `PlanAdjustment`; added new `CoachMessage` table (`id, athlete_id, role, text, suggested_actions_json, created_at`).
- **Schemas** (`app/schemas.py`): enriched `AthleteActivityOut` with `matched_workout_id`, `matched_workout_title`, `match_status`, `delta_summary`. Extended `TodayOut` with `yesterday_workout`, `yesterday_activity`, `recovery_recommendation`. Added Block A1 schemas: `Dashboard*`, `PlanVolumeCurve*`, `RegeneratePreviewOut`, `AdjustmentAffectedWorkout`, `PlanAdjustmentDetailOut`, `PlanAdjustmentApplyRequest`, `CoachMessage*`.
- **Routes** (`app/api/routes.py`):
  - `GET /athletes/{id}/dashboard` — aggregates greeting, today's workout + match, this-week strip, goal w/ prediction history (12 most recent `race_predictor_marathon` snapshots), 8-week volume history (planned vs executed), 7 most recent activities, readiness panel (rhr trend vs 14-day avg, weekly load trend, lthr, ltsp), pending adjustment, last sync meta.
  - `GET /plans/{id}/volume-curve` — full per-week planned/executed/longest-run with `is_current` flag and peak values.
  - `GET /plans/{id}/regenerate-preview?skill_slug=X` — read-only sibling of regenerate-from-today: builds derived race goal context, asks `skill.applicable(ctx)`, returns counts + applicability.
  - `GET /plan-adjustments/{id}` — adjustment detail with parsed `affected_workouts_json`.
  - `POST /plan-adjustments/{id}/apply` — atomic mutation: walks `affected_workouts_json`, applies `distance_m`, `duration_min`, `skip` (sets `MISSED` + zeroes distance), or `workout_type`. Returns 422 when a referenced workout is missing.
  - `POST /coach/message` — persists user msg, dispatches to `interpret_checkin()` when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set; otherwise stub reply "AI 教练当前不可用，请稍后再试". Persists coach reply with optional `suggested_actions_json`.
  - `GET /coach/conversations/{athlete_id}?limit=50` — newest-first pagination.
  - Enhanced `GET /athletes/{id}/history` to wrap each row through `_activity_with_match(db, a)` so `match_status` and `delta_summary` are populated.
  - Enhanced `GET /athletes/{id}/today` with yesterday's workout + matched activity and the `recovery_recommendation` heuristic (≥4 missed in last 7 days).
  - Bug fix as side-effect: the `_AvailabilityShim` in `_availability_for()` was returning a Python list for `unavailable_weekdays`, but `app.core.orchestrator._parse_unavailable` expects the raw comma-string from the model. Replaced the list-comprehension with the raw string. This unblocked the regenerate-preview path that goes through `_build_context`.
- **Tests** (`tests/test_block_a1.py`): 14 tests across 7 TestCase classes covering dashboard with/without plan/activities, volume curve, regenerate preview applicable + not-applicable (frozen most weeks so derived `plan_weeks` < 12), adjustment apply happy paths + 422, coach stub fallback when `OPENAI_API_KEY` empty, coach conversation pagination, history enrichment, today recovery + yesterday surfacing.

Result: `uv run python -m py_compile $(find app -name "*.py")` clean. `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` reports **33 tests pass in ~2.3s** (19 existing + 14 new). No commit yet — awaiting user review.

## 2026-05-02 – Block B: Auth + running_beginner skill + frontend onboarding

### Why
多用户支持需要身份认证层。用户反馈缺少登录页、新人引导和无计划时的默认状态。同时发现新用户没有 COROS 历史时平台无法评估能力，需要一个入门级 skill 兜底。

### How

**后端 — Auth（`app/api/auth.py`、`app/core/auth.py`、`app/models.py`）**

- 新增 `User`（phone、created_at）和 `OTPCode`（phone、code、expires_at、used）模型
- `AthleteProfile` 增加可选 `user_id` FK，支持一个用户多个运动档案
- 30 天无 refresh 的 JWT（stdlib HMAC-SHA256，无第三方依赖）
- `POST /auth/send-otp`：生成 6 位 OTP，mock 模式直接返回 code；`POST /auth/verify-otp`：验证 OTP → 返回 JWT + user_id；`GET /auth/me`：需要 Bearer token
- OTP 10 分钟过期，单次使用

**后端 — `running_beginner` skill（`app/skills/running_beginner/`）**

- 纯规则，不调 LLM
- 16 周三阶段模板：适应期（1-4周）→ 建基期（5-10周）→ 巩固期（11-16周）
- 全程 RPE 4-5 强度，每周 1-3 次，每次不超过 90 分钟
- `applicable()` 门控：平均周跑量超过 40 km 时返回 False，建议使用进阶方法论

**前端 — Auth（`web/lib/auth.ts`、`web/middleware.ts`、`web/lib/api/client.ts`）**

- JWT 存储在 `localStorage['st_token']`
- `middleware.ts`：所有非 `/login`、非 `/api` 路径检查 token，无则跳转 `/login`
- API client 所有请求自动加 `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**前端 — 登录页（`web/app/login/page.tsx`）**

- 两步状态机：phone → OTP → 登录
- 新用户（is_new_user）跳转 `/onboarding`，返回用户跳转 `/dashboard`

**前端 — Onboarding（`web/app/onboarding/page.tsx`）**

- 4 步向导：COROS 连接（可跳过）→ 目标设定（比赛日期、目标时间、经验水平）→ 训练日选择 → 确认
- 完成后依次调：`POST /athletes`、`POST /coros/connect`（optional）、`POST /athletes/{id}/goals`

**前端 — 空状态 + 调整入口**

- `EmptyPlanState`：无计划时在 dashboard 和 plan tab 展示"设定目标 →"CTA，链接到 `/onboarding`
- `PendingAdjustmentSection`：plan tab 底部显示待处理调整数量 + 标题，链接到 `/adjustments/{id}`

### Result

- 后端新增 12 个 auth 测试 + 12 个 beginner skill 测试，全套 71/71 通过（2.6s）
- 前端新增 15 个测试（auth.test.ts、login.test.tsx、onboarding.test.tsx、step6.test.tsx），全套 35/35 通过（< 1s）
- `pnpm type-check` 和 `pnpm build` 通过
- **未解决**：auth 路由保护（`get_current_user` dependency）尚未加到现有 athlete/plan 路由上，待 Block C 前做路由级保护加固

## 2026-05-03 — Block C: Skills / Adjustment / Activities screens

### Why
前端缺少三个核心屏幕：skill 选择与方法论阅读、计划调整详情、历史活动列表。后端端点在 Block A/A1 已完成，本次纯前端工作。使用 feature branch `feat/block-c-screens`，通过 PR 合入 main。

### How

**组件（TDD — 15 个测试先写后实现）**

- `SkillList`：展示 skill 卡片，标记当前 skill，提供"切换"按钮（inactive skill）和"查看方法论"链接
- `SwitchSkillDialog`：显示 regenerate-preview 统计（重新生成课数、影响周数、保留已完成/缺训课数），applicable=false 时禁用确认按钮并展示原因
- `AffectedWorkoutRow`：展示受调整影响的单条课程（日期、标题、变更摘要）
- `ActivityRow`：展示单条历史活动（状态 dot、距离/配速、delta_summary）

**页面**

- `/skills` — 拉 `GET /skills`，点击"切换"先调 `GET /plans/{id}/regenerate-preview` 拿 preview，再弹 SwitchSkillDialog，确认后调 `POST /plans/{id}/regenerate-from-today` 并跳转 dashboard
- `/skills/[slug]` — 拉 `GET /skills/{slug}`，以 `<pre>` 渲染 `methodology_md`（暂不做 Markdown 渲染）
- `/adjustments/[id]` — 拉 `GET /plan-adjustments/{id}`，展示受影响课程列表，接受调用 `POST /plan-adjustments/{id}/apply`，拒绝调用 `POST /plan-adjustments/{id}/reject`，完成后 1.2s 内返回
- `/activities` — 拉 `GET /athletes/{id}/history`，顶部汇总统计（总次数/总公里/完成率），图例说明 5 种状态色点

### Result

- 50/50 前端测试通过（< 1s）
- `pnpm type-check` 通过
- `pnpm build` 通过，新增 5 个编译单元（/skills、/skills/[slug] 动态路由、/adjustments/[id]、/activities）
- 通过 `gh pr create` 提交 PR，分支 `feat/block-c-screens`

## 2026-05-04 — Block D: Route protection + navigation

### Why
세 가지 문제를 한 번에 해결:
1. `/skills`, `/activities` 페이지가 앱 내에서 접근 불가 — Settings 페이지에서 링크 제공
2. 백엔드 API가 인증 없이 모든 athlete/plan 데이터를 반환 — 소규모 다중 사용자 서비스로는 부적합
3. `test_block_a.py`의 LLM 비활성화 버그 (pop vs 빈 문자열) — 테스트가 262초 걸리던 문제

### How

**백엔드 라우트 보호 (`app/api/routes.py`)**

- `from app.core.auth import get_current_user` import 추가
- 21개 라우트 함수에 `_user: "User" = Depends(get_current_user)` 파라미터 추가 (Python 스크립트로 일괄 처리)
- `post_coach_message` 는 여러 줄 시그니처로 스크립트 미적용 → 수동 추가
- 공개 유지: `/health`, `/sports`, `/training/*`, `/skills`, `/skills/{slug}`

**테스트 수정 (TDD: 실패 먼저 작성)**

- `tests/test_auth.py`: `ProtectedRoutesTestCase` 6개 테스트 추가 — 인증 없이 401, 토큰 있으면 200/404 반환
- `tests/helpers.py`: `get_test_token(client, phone)` + `auth(token)` 공유 헬퍼
- `test_block_a.py`, `test_block_a1.py`, `test_coros_marathon_mvp.py`, `test_history_assessment.py`: 모든 setUp에 `self.token = get_test_token(self.client)` 추가, 모든 HTTP 호출에 `headers=auth(self.token)` 전달
- `os.environ.pop("OPENAI_API_KEY", None)` → `os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""` 수정 (`load_local_env`의 `setdefault`가 `.env`에서 덮어쓰는 버그 수정) — 테스트 시간 262s → 1.2s

**프론트엔드 내비게이션 (`web/`)**

- `web/app/settings/page.tsx` 전면 개편: 섹션 기반 설정 페이지 (훈련 · 데이터 · 계정), Skills/Activities/COROS 링크, 로그아웃 (JWT 삭제 + /login 리다이렉트)
- `web/app/(tabs)/dashboard/page.tsx`: header 우상단에 ⚙ 아이콘 추가 → `/settings` 링크

### Result

- 백엔드 77/77 테스트 통과 (18 auth + 17 block_a + 14 block_a1 + 14 beginner + 14 real_coros + 0 existing = 77)
- 프론트엔드 50/50 테스트 통과
- `pnpm type-check` 통과, `pnpm build` 13페이지 컴파일 통과

## 2026-05-05 — SMS country scope correction and local test notes

Why: The user clarified that the previously added mainstream dialing-code list is acceptable and should not be narrowed to China-only. A partial China-only edit had already touched backend phone normalization, frontend dialing regions, and auth tests, so it needed to be reverted carefully without undoing the broader i18n/SMS/COROS work.

How: Restored `app/tools/sms/phone.py` to support the mainstream launch list (`+86`, `+1`, `+44`, `+65`, `+852`, `+886`, `+81`, `+61`) with per-region validation. Restored `web/lib/i18n/countryCodes.ts` to the same list, including `Taiwan, China` / `中国台湾`. Restored `tests/test_auth.py` coverage for US normalization and provider behavior. Updated `tasks/lessons.md` to record that SMS country-scope changes should be clarified before removing existing product support.

Result: Focused backend auth tests passed with `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_auth -v` (25/25). Focused frontend login tests passed with `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/login.test.tsx` (10/10). One earlier frontend test command failed because it used `web/__tests__/login.test.tsx` while already inside `web/`; the corrected relative path is `__tests__/login.test.tsx`.

## 2026-05-05 — COROS settings page and Plan empty-state translation

Why: User found two product-facing gaps while testing the bilingual app: the Plan tab empty state still showed `Build your next training cycle` in Chinese mode, and Settings > COROS sync linked to `/settings/coros`, which did not exist and returned a 404. COROS setup needs to be directly testable from Settings.

How: Updated `web/lib/i18n/copy.ts` so `zh.emptyPlan` has Chinese title/body/action copy. Added `web/app/settings/coros/page.tsx`, a real COROS settings flow backed by existing API routes: `GET /coros/status?athlete_id=1`, `POST /coros/connect`, and `POST /coros/import?athlete_id=1`. The page shows connection state, account, last login/import/sync timestamps, last error, encrypted-password note, connect form, and manual import action. Added `CorosStatusOut` and `DeviceAccountOut` frontend types. Added `web/__tests__/corosSettings.test.tsx` for Chinese empty-plan copy plus COROS status/connect/import request behavior.

Result: `cd web && pnpm test __tests__/corosSettings.test.tsx __tests__/blockE.test.tsx` passed (14/14). `cd web && pnpm type-check` passed. Full `cd web && pnpm test` passed (76/76; jsdom still emits the known non-fatal `--localstorage-file` warning). `cd web && pnpm build` passed and generated `/settings/coros` as a static route. `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-05-05 — Duplicate COROS account dashboard crash

Why: User hit a backend 500 while testing COROS setup. The traceback showed `sqlalchemy.exc.MultipleResultsFound` at `_device_account(...).scalar_one_or_none()` during dashboard meta construction. Local data can contain more than one `device_accounts` row for the same athlete/device, especially after repeated setup attempts or historical behavior, so dashboard/status must tolerate duplicates instead of crashing.

How: Updated `_device_account()` in `app/api/routes.py` to order matching device accounts by newest `id` and return the first row. This preserves existing callers and makes connect/status/dashboard/import/sync choose a deterministic active row when duplicates already exist. Added `test_dashboard_tolerates_duplicate_coros_accounts` in `tests/test_block_a1.py`, inserting two COROS accounts for one athlete and asserting both dashboard and `/coros/status` return 200 while using the newest account.

Result: `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_block_a1.BlockA1DashboardNoPlanTestCase -v` passed (2/2). `uv run python -m unittest tests.test_block_a1 -v` passed (15/15). Full `uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` passed (91/91). A first attempt to run two backend unittest commands in parallel caused shared `st_test.db` interference (`no such table` / missing athlete), so `tasks/lessons.md` now records that backend unittest commands using the same SQLite file must run sequentially.
